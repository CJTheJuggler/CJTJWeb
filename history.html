            <p class="user-profession">This is the year when I started off my circus adventure. <br>

              A guy called Steve Burrows came into my primary school to teach a group of student’s different skills; one
              of which was circus. As a group we were to put on a show at some point in the school year. We all split up
              to learn different props within the circus but no one wanted to learn how to juggle. He pulled us all
              together and asked if there was anyone willing to swap to juggling, so I did. I learnt to juggle and then
              later went on to perform it in the show. <br>

              This was my starting point in the circus, the moment I knew I had a skill that I never wanted to lose.</p>

            <p class="user-profession">My second year of highschool, I finally plucked upp the courage to start clowning
              around and showing off
              what i could do. I knew there would be a tallent show at some point in the year so i plucked up the
              courage
              to make a routine and perform which i did. I got such a adreniline rush from doing this, performance
              created
              by me to one of my favourite music tracks (at the time). i got first place in the tallent show becasue it
              was such a unique thing that the judges probably hadnt seen before. <br>
              From doing that performance i had a teacher apporach me and asked if i knew how to unicycle, which i
              didn't
              little did i know there was a teacher in the school who not only could ride them but was willing to teach
              me. 6 months later and some money later to buy my own uniccycle i was riding up and down the road.</p>

            <p class="user-profession">The height of Covid: How can we all forget it? Being told to stay indoors and
              only going out if necessary. I
              took the “Hour of allowed exercise” to go unicycling around my local area to try and put a smile on any
              one
              passing by. I had also gone out to do a photoshoot with my friend for their college work. They needed to
              get
              some unique action shots, which is where I come into this. They approached me and asked if i was up for it
              and of course my answer was yes, so we circled out to one of the local woodlands and ended up doing a
              whole
              day photo shoot, getting photos of me juggling and spinning LED Poi.</p>

            <p class="user-profession">This was the year I turned 18, in which was the year I could finally start
              performing and practicing fire on
              my own. On my 18th birthday I had such a memorable birthday. I had invited the different friend groups to
              meet
              up and enjoy a night together, in which my circus friends had planned something sneakily. I was told the
              plan
              was to get some fire props and we’d be having a little burn, however when they arrived they brought all of
              their fire kits and we put on a show.</p>

            <h2 class="user-name">2024</h2>
            <p class="user-profession">Ah, the year I truly started to get performances under my feet. To kick off my
              fiery year in July I got the
              amazing opportunity to perform fire at the Barefoot Festival thanks to the Combust fire group and flambè.
              <br>

              Only a few months later I was asked to do a Halloween performance which was my first truly solo
              performance
              involving fire. It was such a thrill but behind the scenes it was chaos. I hadn't realized how much
              planning
              went into doing this caliber. but nonetheless it was a success, with an estimated 700 people seeing me and
              my performances. <br>

              To close off the year, I was given the opportunity to travel to my partner’s family and perform on new
              years
              eve in their last house party of the year. This was one awesome experience. <br>

              2024 turned out to be the year that truly kick started me into my circus performances.
